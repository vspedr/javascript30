# Day 2 - Clock

## What I've learned from this class

- It seems I can't have a ref to the DOM node of styled components :/ maybe they will fix it with forward refs from React;
- Using refs with stateless function components is another no-go;
- Need to solve the backward-loop when the hands get to 12.
