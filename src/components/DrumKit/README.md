# Day 1 - DrumKit

## What I've learned from this class

- I learned about the `<audio>` element in a page and how to control it using pure JS
- I learned about the `<kbd>` element;
- I had a great time refactoring the code to separate concerns from the key elements from the app itself (regarding event handlers), creating reusable components with React while still using vanilla JS for the core concepts;
- `styled-components` is awesome!
