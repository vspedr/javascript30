# Day 3 - Playing with  CSS Variables

## What I've learned from this class

- Discovered a few more properties from the `document` object from debugging the CSS variables
- CSS variables and styled-components work just fine
- Must not forget to explicitly set className for derived styled components :D
- TODO: investigate if there is a way to set styles on :root and body with styled-components
- TODO: jump off the styled-components hype train
- TODO: turn this repo into a SPA with all mini-projects. Come up with a nice solution for navigation
